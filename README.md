[7-zip LZMA SDK](http://7-zip.org/sdk.html)
==============

This repository contains the LZMA SDK that provides the documentation, samples, header files, libraries, and tools you need to develop applications that use LZMA compression.

LZMA is the default and general compression method of 7z format in the 7-Zip program. LZMA provides a high compression ratio and very fast decompression, so it is very suitable for embedded applications. For example, it can be used for ROM (firmware) compressing.

This repository **only contains the Java version** of the source code.

As stated in the [7-zip](http://7-zip.org/sdk.html) the ZMA SDK is placed in the public domain.
